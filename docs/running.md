# Running & verifying

Building a compositor raises an obvious problem: how do you check that a
change actually works, when the thing you built *is* the environment
everything else renders inside? This chapter is less "here's the command"
(the [README](https://github.com/sn3rt/0xide#readme) covers that) and more
about the verification habits that came out of building 0xide without a
synthetic-input tool available in the dev environment (no `wtype`/`ydotool`)
— every recipe here exists because "just try it and see" wasn't always
possible.

## Nested first, always

The nested Wayland backend — `cargo nested` — is the primary loop for a
reason: it's the only mode where 0xide runs *inside* something that can
already show you its output, with no modesetting, no VT, no real display
hardware involved. Every stage was built and mostly verified nested before
it was ever tried on a real TTY.

Two things about the nested backend are easy to get bitten by:

- **It only receives keys when the host compositor gives its window focus.**
  A "keybinding does nothing" bug is, more often than not, a focus bug in
  the *host* desktop, not in 0xide.
- **The host may already own the modifier you want.** `OXIDE_MOD=alt`
  exists because a host compositor (Hyprland, in this project's case) grabs
  Super-chords before a nested 0xide window ever sees them.

## Verifying without synthetic input

With no way to script a keypress or click into the agent loop, verification
leans on two things instead:

1. **A real client's own behavior as a signal.** `wayland-info` connecting
   and listing 0xide's globals (`wl_shm`, `zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1`,
   `wl_compositor`, `wl_data_device_manager`, ...) proves the Wayland server
   is actually up, independent of anything visual. A real app (`foot`,
   `kitty`) refusing to start with "no seats available" is exactly as
   informative as it succeeding — it's how the missing-`wl_seat` gap at
   Stage 3 was caught.
2. **Log markers plus a screenshot**, for anything visual:
   ```sh
   target/debug/0xide >/tmp/0xide.log 2>&1 &
   PID=$!; sleep 3
   grim /tmp/0xide.png     # screenshot the host screen, including 0xide's window
   kill $PID
   ```
   wlroots' debug log (on via `oxide_log_init()`) is very verbose — the
   first few hundred lines are EGL/DMA-BUF format enumeration — so the
   useful signal is 0xide's own `println!` markers plus lines like
   `Allocated ... GBM buffer` / `DMA-BUF imported`, read alongside the PNG.

Keyboard *wiring* (as opposed to actual typing) is verified the same way —
log markers like "keyboard attached" / "keyboard focus -> toplevel" confirm
the plumbing is connected; actually typing into a client is checked by hand,
by focusing the nested window on the host and typing.

## Config, without a window

The config parser (`src/config.rs`) doesn't need a display to verify at all:

```sh
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/cfg WLR_BACKENDS=headless target/debug/0xide >log 2>&1 &
grep -E '0xide: (loaded|no config|modifier|config line)' log
```

An unparseable config line warns on stderr and is skipped — startup never
fails on a bad config line — so the grep above is also the fastest way to
confirm a hand-edited `0xide.conf` actually parsed the way you intended.

## Multi-output, nested

The nested Wayland backend honors `WLR_WL_OUTPUTS=2`, opening two host
windows — enough to verify per-output tiling, focus-follows-monitor, and
(later) config-driven monitor position/scale without touching real hardware:

```sh
WLR_WL_OUTPUTS=2 OXIDE_MOD=alt target/debug/0xide foot
```

Two `output <name> online @ X,Y WxH — workspace N` log lines confirm both
outputs came up and where the layout placed them.

## Real hardware

On a bare TTY, `wlr_backend_autocreate` picks the DRM/KMS backend instead
(no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` to detect). The one recurring hardware quirk worth
knowing before you hit it: on a machine with two GPUs, wlroots may pick the
wrong `/dev/dri/cardN` — `WLR_DRM_DEVICES=/dev/dri/cardN` forces the right
one.

VT switching (`Ctrl+Alt+F1..F12`) is its own verification loop: switch away,
switch back, and watch for a clean repaint rather than a black/frozen
screen. That specific failure mode — outputs come back black after a VT
resume — is what drove the session-active-signal handling described in
[Stage 6](phases/stage-6-real-display.md); a forced repaint on the first few
frames after resume is the fix, and the regression test for it is "does the
screen come back," not something a unit test can cover.
